# Identity Server

This is a sample repo i have used on previous environments in order to quickly configure an [Identity Server](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4) environment. The original Api is taken from the [Identity Server Quickstart UI](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4.Quickstart.UI). The Admin UI is a quick poc and shouldnt be in used in prod.
